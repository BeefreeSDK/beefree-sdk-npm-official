A simple module to use the [BEE editor](http://beefree.io)

## Why BEE Plugin?
Choose a reliable, easy to integrate multi-content type digital platform you can build on. BEE Plugin is more than an embeddable visual builder with a great drag-n-drop user experience. Itâ€™s a reliable, highly-customizable email, landing page & popup builder.

Go from proof-of-concept to production in days, not months. BEE Plugin can be highly customized in the way it looks, what it does and how it interacts with your application. Deliver your business exactly what it needs, with a small development effort

You can embed it into your application!

Visit our developer documentation [https://docs.beefree.io/]


## How to use it 

- go to the developer portal [https://developers.beefree.io/signup](https://developers.beefree.io/signup)
- sign up with the free plan
- create your application
- get the clientId and the clientSecret

## Demo

It's free to use on ['https://beefree.io'](https://beefree.io): you don't even need to create an account of any kind.


## Do you want to try out an integration locally?

1. Install Nodejs (also npm, which should come with nodejs already) or Yarn.
2. clone this repository
3. `npm install` or `yarn install`(if you have it installed) in the folder cloned
4. rename the local `.env.sample` file into `.env`
5. run `npm start` or `yarn start`
6. Open `http://localhost:8080`.
7. Have fun!


## How to use this module for your own

### install

> You can either install it with [npm](https://nodejs.org) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

```sh
npm install --save @mailupinc/bee-plugin
```
or
```sh
yarn add @mailupinc/bee-plugin
```

## Initialize the plugin
### Get token(clientId, clientSecret)
> You need to be authorized to start using the editor: beefree help documentation portal [has a nice post](http://help.beefree.io/hc/en-us/articles/202991192-Initializing-the-plugin) explaining how to do it

It's not really raccomended to do it client side but it's possible with the module, just call getToken.

Pass your credential on `getToken` method and start the plugin in the returning promise. Example below:

```js
import BeePlugin from '@mailupinc/bee-plugin'

// put your credentials in the .env file
const clientId = process.env.PLUGIN_CLIENT_ID
const clientSecret = process.env.PLUGIN_CLIENT_SECRET
const beeConfig = {...}

const template = {...}
const beeTest = new BeePlugin(token, authConfiguration)

beeTest.getToken(clientId, clientSecret)
  .then(() => beeTest.start(beeConfig, template))

```

### new Bee(token, authConf?)
> Initialize the BEE instance with a server side generated token

```js

import BeePlugin from '@mailupinc/bee-plugin'

const authConf = {...}
const beeConfig = {...}
const template = {...}

// you can add you personal configuration, if you omit some properties, plugin will use it's default configuration
const authConfiguration = {
  authUrl: process.env.YOR_AUTH_URL,
  beePluginUrl: process.env.YOR_HOST_PLUGIN_URL
}
const beeInstance = new BeePlugin(token, authConf)
beeInstance.start(beeConfig, template)
```

## Configuring the editor (beeConfig)
> It requires a configuration for using the editor, beefree help documentation portal [has a nice post](http://help.beefree.io/hc/en-us/articles/202991192-Initializing-the-plugin) explaining how to do it

Here is an example of the configuration; just read the official documentation for an extended version

```js

const beeConfig = {
  uid: 'test1-clientside', //needed for identify resources of the that user and billing stuff
  container: 'bee-plugin-container', //Identifies the id of div element that contains BEE Plugin
  language: 'en-US',
  onSave: (jsonFile, htmlFile) => {
    console.log('onSave', jsonFile, htmlFile)
  },
  onSaveAsTemplate: (jsonFile) => {
    console.log('onSaveAsTemplate', jsonFile)
  },
  onSend: (htmlFile) => {
    console.log('onSend', htmlFile)
  },
  onError: (errorMessage) => {
    console.log('onError ', errorMessage)
  }
}

```

## Template JSON
> It requires an initial template for start editing, learn more [here](http://help.beefree.io/hc/en-us/articles/203135882-Sample-code-and-templates)

Some json avaible here  [https://github.com/BEE-Plugin/BEE-FREE-templates](https://github.com/BEE-Plugin/BEE-FREE-templates)

## After you have started the editor it's possible to trigger this methods

this return a promise that has resolved after we call the plugin start function
